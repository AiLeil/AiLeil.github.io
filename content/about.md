Hi, this is Ben.

I am a Chinese student, currently 24 years old (as of 2026). I completed my Bachelor of Mathematics at the University of Waterloo in 2025, and I plan to pursue a Master of Information Technology at the University of Melbourne.

This website is intended as a personal space for organizing projects, notes, and occasional writing. Some content may be exploratory or informal in nature, and parts of the writing may be revised or assisted by AI tools when appropriate.

Outside of academic and technical interests, I enjoy playing poker and board games, and I also play basketball in my spare time.
